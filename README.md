# Sch0lar Contracts

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks with Hardhat:

```shell

npx hardhat accounts

npx hardhat compile

npx hardhat clean

npx hardhat test

npx hardhat node

node scripts/sample-script.js

npx hardhat help

```

# To start

Start a local node (local blockchain)

```shell

npx hardhat node

```

Open a new terminal and deploy the smart contract in the localhost network

```shell

npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js

```

Then, copy the address and paste it into the "address" property in sch0lar.io-frontend/src/abis/DigitalIdentity.json to point the frontend at the smart contract.
